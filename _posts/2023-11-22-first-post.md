# Project: GNNs with Julia

Here is a [link](https://github.com/asopio/julia-gnns-lundplane) to a project using the FLux.jl library in Julia to train and evaluate Graph Neural Networks. This is smiliar to the PyTorch code we used on ATLAS to create a LundNet jet tagger. Jets can be constructed and de-clustered in Julia using the python fastnet bindings.
